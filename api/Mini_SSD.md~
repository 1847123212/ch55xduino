# Mini_SSD1306

This is a library for monochrome OLEDs based on SSD1306 drivers.

This library is a cut-down version of the original
[Adafruit library ssd1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306).
This version of the library does not depend on the Adafruit_GFX library and
has a _much_ smaller memory footprint than the full version, but most of the
graphical features are missing.

It only supports I2C communication. My display uses the I2C address 0x3C,
but there are similar displays out there configured to use the address 0x3D.
If you have one of those you need to modifiy the library source file.
