### Known problems using Windows

It works, but using the Arduino.mk makefile with Windows is slow. **Very**
slow. Painfully slow. Compiling-the-Blink-example-takes-about-40-seconds
kind of slow. Yes, seriously. No kidding. 40 seconds. Measured on a 3GHz
machine with 4GB RAM.

There is no easy fix, the underlying problem is a fundamental one. It is not
about the compilation itself, it is the way Makefiles are written and
executed. The whole concept relies on forking subprocesses for all the shell
calls. Unfortunately, there is nothing like a fork in Windows and to work
around that is painfully slow.

It would be great if somebody would replace the painfully slow parameter
checking part of the makefile (that causes the majority of forking) by a
single shell script that gets called by the makefile and delivers the
results in no time. Or use [cmake](www.cmake.org). Or integrate it somehow
into the STVD IDE (This [STVD-SDCC integration
suite](https://github.com/shkolnick-kun/stvd-sdcc) might be useful). Or
whatever.

Until then the least annoying way out might be using a virtual machine
running a simple Linux system. Ubuntu Mate or a basic Debian install for
example. Virtual Box is great for this purpose and freely available. The new
Linux Subsystem feature of Windows 10 might be another option.
