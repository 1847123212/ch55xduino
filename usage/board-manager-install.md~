# Installation

There are two very different ways to install Sduino:
[Manual](manual-install) or using the Arduino Board Manager.


## Using the Arduino Board Manager

This is the recommanded way of installation now.

- Open the Settings tab of the Preferences dialog
- Enter
  `https://github.com/tenbaht/sduino/raw/master/package_sduino_stm8_index.json`
  as an Additional Boards Manager URL
- Select *sduino* in the Boards Manager list (Tools->Board:...->Boards Manager)
- Click on Install

Wait for the download to finsh and you are ready to blink:

- Open the Boards list at Tools->Board:...
- You should find a new entry "STM8S Boards".
- Choose *STM8S103F3 Breakout Board* from the list
- Open the standard Blink example from File->Examples->01. Basics->Blink
- Compile it by hitting 'Verify'

Wasn't too hard, was it?



## Alternative way of installation

The Arduino Board Manager is now the recommended way of installation. If you
outgrow it's possibilities it is easy to [update to the manual
install](update-to-manual). The manual install gives you more flexibility,
but is only useful if you are planning to use development or experimental
branches of Sduino or if you prefer a GUI-less build system controlled by a
Makefile.

Let's compare:

|		| Board Manager	|[manual install](manual-install)
|----		|-----		|------
|Difficulty	|very easy	|easy on Linux and MacOS, more difficult on Windows.
|Used Packages	|latest release	|release, development or experimental
|IDE/GUI based builds|yes		|yes
|Makefile based builds|no		|yes
|Compiling without Arduino libraries|no	|yes
