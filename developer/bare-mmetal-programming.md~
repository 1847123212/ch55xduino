blinky.c: LED pin assignment

**uart.c**:  pin assignment (TX is at PD5, RX is at PD6).  
The UART is sending at 1200 Baud => CPU clock only 2MHz instead of 16MHz.
The clock divider needs to be configured or a different baud rate prescale value
has to be used. Pitfall: The register address for the clock divider is
different for the STM8S and the STM8L.
